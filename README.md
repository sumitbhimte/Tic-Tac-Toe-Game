# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
  Unit Testing on XO Game

## PURPOSE

  The purpose of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get
three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a row in a 4-by-4 grid.To
start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually
3-by-3 or 4-by-4.

  In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always
goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until
either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw
three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares
are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os,
then the game is a draw.

  One of the game’s best strategies involves creating a "fork,"
which is placing your mark in such a way that you have the opportunity
to win two ways on your next turn. Your opponent can only
block one, thereby, you can win after that.

## JUnit 

- JUnit is an open source Unit Testing Framework for JAVA. 
- It is useful for Java Developers to write and run repeatable tests.
- JUnit is an open source framework, which is used for writing and running tests.
- Provides annotations to identify test methods.
- Provides assertions for testing expected results.
- Provides test runners for running tests.
- JUnit tests allow you to write codes faster, which increases quality.
- JUnit is elegantly simple. It is less complex and takes less time.
- JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their own results and provide immediate feedback.
- There’s no need to manually combbining through a report of test results.
- JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites.
- JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if the test is running smoothly, and it turns red when a test fails.
